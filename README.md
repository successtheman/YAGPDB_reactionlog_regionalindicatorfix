# YAGPDB Reaction-Logs RegionalIndicator fix


**This is only for the reaction-logs custom command for [YAGPDB.xyz](https://yagpdb.xyz) discord bot (I was too lazy to add more stuff to it so I just made a custom fork)**

This fixes the YAGPDB.xyz [custom command for reaction-logs.](https://yagpdb-cc.github.io/utilities/reaction-logs) By default they don't show the regional indicators for some reason in discord and I am too lazy to try and scrape another site so this works. Enjoy

Should work for a while... I will ***probably*** fix it if it breaks


## **Installation**

To install it, copy the original custom command by [@Satty9361](https://github.com/Satty9361) which you can find [here](https://yagpdb-cc.github.io/utilities/reaction-logs) and then replace the line that reads 

`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iamcal/emoji-data/master/img-google-136/` 

with 

`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/successtheman/YAGPDB_reactionlog_regionalindicatorfix/master/img-google-136/`

**That's it, enjoy the Regional Indicators working with the reaction-logs custom command for [YAGPDB.xyz](https://yagpdb.xyz)**
